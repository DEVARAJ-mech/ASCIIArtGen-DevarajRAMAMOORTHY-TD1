# ASCIIArtGen-DevarajRAMAMOORTHY-TD1
The project contains the code for the application that can display the text to ASCII art form
3D ASCII Art Generator
The 3D ASCII Art Generator is a web application that allows users to convert input text into ASCII art and visualize it in 3D. This project includes a Python backend (Flask) and a JavaScript-based frontend, offering an interactive experience for generating and exploring ASCII art in a creative way.

Features
Generate ASCII Art: Converts user input text into ASCII art using the pyfiglet library.
3D Visualization: Displays the ASCII art in a 3D format using Plotly.js.
Font Selection: Allows users to select different ASCII art fonts (optional feature).
Download ASCII Art: Enables downloading the generated ASCII art as a .txt file.
Simple and Interactive UI: A clean and intuitive interface to make the process easy for users.
Technologies Used
Backend:
Flask: Python web framework to handle requests and process ASCII art generation.
pyfiglet: Python library for creating ASCII art from text.
Flask-CORS: To handle cross-origin requests between frontend and backend.
Frontend:
HTML/CSS: For the web interface.
JavaScript: For user interactions and communicating with the backend.
Plotly.js: For rendering 3D visualizations of the ASCII art.
Installation
Prerequisites:
Python 3.7 or later
A web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
Node.js (optional for advanced customizations)
Steps to Set Up the Project:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
